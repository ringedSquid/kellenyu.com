# FTC Robotics
I was on FTC 479 for two years in high school. I learned alot about CAD design, machining, 3D printing, and general robotics through this. After working on the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy Robot, I was appointed to the head of engineering and oversaw the development of the 2022 summer robot and the 2022-2023 Power Play Robot.
