## Intake

- Flip down intake with the ability to store up to 3 balls at a time.
- Upon the successful acquirement of balls, the intake then rotates to act as a transfer mechanism.
- Belts run across the intake, which move balls into the shooter mechanism. 
- A stopper is implemented in order to prevent the unintended release of balls from the transfer.
- The entire mechanism can be rotated around an axle via the use of 2 servos which are belted to it. 
- Plates are made out of 1/8in aluminium and are pocketed in order to reduce weight.
