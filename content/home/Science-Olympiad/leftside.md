# Science-Olympiad
I was a part of the Stuyvesant Science Olympiad Team from 2023 to 2025 and served as Tech Captain in 2025. <br>
I primarily worked on the tech events, with some examples being Robot Tour, Electric Vehicle, and Detector Building. I brought PCB design and a general CAD/EDA focused workflow to my team. <br>
This was a high school activity that really helped me to develop my skills and meet amazing people! <br>
